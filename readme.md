# Better Understanding Flask

This is a follow-along with a YouTube tutorial for building a website using Flask. Following along with the quick start guide was difficult because a lot of contextual knowledge was not possessed. This tutorial should add some context to some of the functions that were used and enable us to better understand the flask tutorial.

The goals of this tutorial are to make a very basic web template that can be adapted to suit most use cases. The tutorial will cover the following topics:

1. Creating users
2. Storing credentials in a database
3. Logging in and out
4. Associating data with users

We will be signing in, creating notes, and deleting notes. Simple, but the knowledge is the key here. Most websites will use 90% of the same code and teach us about webdev. We're not going to be doing front-end development here. We don't really need to know javascript or html. We're going to be focusing on the backend.
